# Contributing to the University Portal Mobile App

Welcome to the University Portal Mobile App project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this project. Your contributions can help make this app even better.

Before you get started, please take a moment to read through this document to understand how you can contribute and the guidelines you should follow.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone [your_fork_url]
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your work:

   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Make your changes, improvements, or fixes.
   When developing new features or experimenting with the codebase, you might want to create files that should not be tracked by Git to avoid cluttering the main repository. A common practice is to prefix these file names with a `+` sign. For example, naming a file `+experiment.py` will make it clear that this file is for personal or temporary use and should not be included in version control.

5. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages:

   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

   > you can refer to this [link](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for more information on conventional commits

6. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Create a pull request (PR) to the main repository. Be sure to include a clear description of your changes.

8. Your PR will be reviewed, and any necessary adjustments or discussions will take place.

9. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
